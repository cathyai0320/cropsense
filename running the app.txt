is located.
Install the required packages with pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run the Flask App:

In the flask-app directory, set the environment variable for Flask: 
export FLASK_APP=app.py (on Unix/macOS) or set FLASK_APP=app.py 
(on Windows).
Run the application with flask run.
Running Frontend
